        Ways to procure goods and services
      </h2>

      <p>There are two main methods for procuring for schools:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
         <li><a href="#frameworks">using a framework</a></li>
         <li><a href="#tender">running your own buying process</a></li>
       </ol>

       <p>DfE recommend that schools use frameworks as they offer good value &ndash; saving time and money and ensuring compliance with <a href="#0">EU procurement thresholds</a>.</p>

       {{ govukInsetText({
         html: 'Always follow your school&rsquo;s procurement rules. These may be your schoolâ€™s own rules, or set by the local authority.'
       }) }}

      <h2 id="frameworks" class='govuk-heading-l'>
        Using a framework
      </h2>

      <p>Frameworks are a type of contract with agreed terms and conditions for buying goods, works or services for your school. You can use them without having to run a full buying process.</p>

      <p>Each framework agreement will have:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>details of the products and services available</li>
        <li>an agreed pricing structure</li>
        <li>details of the suppliers</li>
        <li>instructions on how to buy</li>
        <li>an agreed set of terms and conditions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>
        Framework benefits
      </h3>

      <p>Buying from a framework will usually be quicker and easier than getting bids or quotes because the agreements:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>have already been through a full competitive tender process</li>
        <li>have been quality checked</li>
        <li>are checked to make sure they comply with the law</li>
        <li>may have draft specifications and help available</li>
      </ul>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: 'Find a framework',
        href: 'find-framework/start',
        classes: 'govuk-button--start govuk-!-margin-bottom-9'
      }) }}





      <h2 id="tender" class='govuk-heading-l'>
        Running your own buying process
      </h2>

      <p>If you cannot get what you need through a framework agreement you&rsquo;ll have to run your own buying process. Your school&rsquo;s procurement rules will set the method you need to follow, but it will usually involve:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>deciding how you will assess the bids</li>
        <li>getting quotes from at least 3 suppliers</li>
        <li>assessing all the quotes you get fairly</li>
        <li>choosing the supplier that offers best value for money</li>
      </ul>

      <p>See <a href="#0">running your own buying process</a> for more guidance.</p>

      <h3 class='govuk-heading-m'>
        Finding a supplier
      </h3>

      <p>The <a href="#0">schools contract finder</a> allows schools to find suppliers to procure goods and service by posting specifications which suppliers can see.</p>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: 'Post a specification',
        href: 'find-supplier/start',
        classes: 'govuk-button--start'
